These Permit The Bees To Leave The Hive When Going To The Fields And Are So Arranged That The Returning Bees Are Led To Enter The New Brood Chamber. This Is Accomplished By Means Of Switches In The Bottom Board Or By A Chute Or Tube So Attached That The Entrance To The Old Brood Chamber Is Closed, Allowing Exit Only Through The Tube Which Opens Near The Entrance Of The New Brood Chamber. In Either Case The Hives Are So Arranged That The Bees Returning From The Field Readily Enter The New Brood Chamber. The Queen Is Found And Together With A Comb Of Brood And Adhering Bees Is Put Into The New Brood Chamber, And The Supers Are Transferred From The Old To « 40 » The New Brood Chamber. The Young Bees As They Learn To Fly Are Added To The Swarm By The Same Device. Otherwise The Manipulation Is The Same As The Other Methods Described.</h3><h3>Separating The Queen And Brood Within The Hive.</h3></div> </div>
