If this is not possible the very weak colonies can more profitably be used for purposes other than comb-honey production. Another plan of equalizing is that of shaking bees from combs taken from strong colonies at the entrance of colonies less strong. The older bees at once take wing and return to their hives, while the younger bees enter the weaker colony. The operator must, of course, be sure that the queen is not on the comb thus shaken.) )</p><p>Some of the advantages of building up the colonies as individuals are: (1 The labor required is considerably less, fewer visits being required, so that this method is particularly adapted to out-apiary conditions. (2 It is possible to determine with much greater accuracy which colonies show the most desirable traits for breeding purposes. (3) It can be more safely practiced if brood diseases are imminent.) )</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
