To allow such a colony to requeen itself usually results in its casting an "after-swarm," since it becomes quite « 32 » populous again before the young queens emerge. This plan does not make immediate use of the emerging bees but may be useful under some conditions. (3 If the honey flow is of long duration or is followed closely by a second, two parent colonies, as in (2) above, may be placed upon the same stand, one of which is given a queen but with the queen cells destroyed in the other. After two or three weeks the bees may be shaken from the queenless colony in with the queen-right one. Such colonies are in excellent condition for rapid work in the supers.) )</p></div> </div>
