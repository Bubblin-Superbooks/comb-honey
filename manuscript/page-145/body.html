The bees are more inclined to stain the white surface of the combs toward the close of the honey flow or during very slow flows. Trouble from this source is at such time intensified because of the uneven progress of work in the different sections, the more advanced sections therefore being sealed some time before the super is sufficiently advanced to justify its removal. Another form of discoloration is brought about by the honey being sealed in close proximity to old and dark « 44 » brood combs, in which case some of the darker wax from the old combs is sometimes apparently used for capping the honey.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">During a good honey flow all except the last supers may be left upon the hives until all or nearly all of the sections of honey are sealed, since (1 there is little trouble from "travel stain" when work is progressing</p></div> </div>
