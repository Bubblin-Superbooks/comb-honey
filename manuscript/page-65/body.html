This may to some extent justify the saying among beekeepers that if the early flowers yield well the season « 21 » will be good. The progressive beekeeper, however, provides conditions favorable to brood rearing even though the early flowers fail to yield nectar. It is therefore highly important (1 that each colony be in a normal condition at a period six or eight weeks previous to the honey flow, and (2 that brood rearing be at its maximum for the entire period of six or eight weeks during which the brood is reared to produce workers available for the honey flow.) )</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
